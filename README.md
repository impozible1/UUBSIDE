# UUBSIDE<br>
Uncool Unoriginal Bland Stupid Integrated Developer Environment<br>
-or-<br>
UUBSIDE

Created with CodeSandbox (and impozible1)<br>
A browser-based IDE (if you would even call it that)

This is just a beta version of something I thought would be cool.<br>
Going to add a lot more features soon. This is my first time working with CodeSandbox,<br>
and I have to say I prefer replit more. The new features that I will add will be<br>
made in replit.<br>

# Features<br>
* Basic Text Editor
* Indentation Support<br>

That's basically it.

# Coming Soon (Maybe)<br>
* Code Preview (for HTML)
* Console
* Github integration
